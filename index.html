        <h3>Meet Mylo! 🐾</h3>
        <p>
          In 2023, our family was lucky enough to welcome a 2-year-old Mini
          Poodle named Mylo, who we adopted from Sunny Meadows Farm in Philly.
          He’s a bit shy around new faces, but once he’s comfortable, he’s all
          energy and affection. Mylo absolutely thrives with his family and
          becomes the center of attention with his playful personality.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of his favorite activities is zooming around the house, especially
          when there’s a stuffed animal in sight. It’s like a game for him,
          though we’ve learned that the stuffed toys rarely survive his
          enthusiastic play. But honestly, watching him go after them with such
          excitement is one of the highlights of our day.
        </p>

        <p>
          When he’s not playing, Mylo is all about cuddling and being the center
          of attention. He’s an absolute cuddle machine, always seeking out a
          lap or a snuggle buddy. But fair warning—if you’re in the same room as
          him, be prepared for a barrage of kisses, because Mylo is definitely a
          licking enthusiast.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, Mylo is the kind of dog who makes everything better. His
          goofy antics, endless love, and infectious energy bring joy to our
          home every single day, and we can’t imagine life without him.
